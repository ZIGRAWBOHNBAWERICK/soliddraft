# SolidDraft

A parametric CAD application written in Rust, free for everyone, for ever.

**Status:** SolidDraft is not released for download yet. A release with the features below is coming soon. For now it is research grade only.

## Why this is free

Nearly every commercial CAD program you can buy runs on one of a handful of closed geometry kernels. Parasolid, ACIS, CGM and a few others sit under SolidWorks, Inventor, Fusion, NX, CATIA and most of the rest. Their owners licence them, meter them and can withdraw them. The maths inside is a century old and the algorithms are published. What is closed is the code, and the code is kept closed by law.

That law is not property. Property exists because things are scarce. If you take my lathe, I no longer have a lathe. If you copy my kernel, I still have my kernel, and now you have one too. Ideas, formulas and programs are not scarce in that sense, so the "intellectual property" over them has to be manufactured by the state: a grant that forbids you from arranging your own bits in a pattern someone else arranged first. Murray Rothbard said it of patents in 1962: "Patents, therefore, are grants of exclusive monopoly privilege by the State" (Man, Economy, and State, ch. 10, sec. 7, Mises Institute edition, https://mises.org/online-book/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/10-monopoly-and-competition/7-patents-and-copyrights). Rothbard kept copyright as a kind of contract. Stephan Kinsella took the argument the rest of the way: "Ideas are not naturally scarce" (Against Intellectual Property, Journal of Libertarian Studies 15:2, 2001, "Scarcity and Ideas"). We stand with that reading.

Apply it to CAD. Geometry is mathematics and belongs to everyone. A B-rep kernel is a set of theorems with a type system around them. There is no good reason the ground every CAD tool stands on should be owned by three companies and rented to everyone else. A public kernel is the ground a free market in CAD tools can grow on: small vendors, scripts, plug-ins and one-person products that do not have to ask anyone's permission to exist. Closed kernels did not make CAD good. They made it expensive and slow to change.

So this app is public. Free to use, change and share, for good.

## What we are attempting

SolidDraft and Catallax are an attempt to put the strongest AI reasoning available to work on CAD: better modelling tools and a geometry kernel that anyone can study, build and improve. Almost all of the code is written by AI coding agents, directed and reviewed by a human. Whether that approach works at the scale CAD demands is the open question. We will find out in public.

## About the licence

An honest objection: an open-source licence is itself a copyright instrument. You cannot refuse copyright. It attaches to code the moment it is written, whether the author wants it or not. The only way to hand it back is a licence or a waiver, and that document borrows the state's rule to undo the state's rule. We accept that. The licence here does not exist to exclude anyone. It gives away, in writing, every right the law handed us by default, and keeps one thing, the author's name on the work.

Licensed under MIT. The licence is used for one purpose only: to keep the credit line below attached to copies of this work.

## Sponsorship

Help fund SolidDraft and Catallax through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/BohnBawerick) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/pedropaiva56920). Both support the same project, started by Zigrawbohnbawerick Pty Ltd.

## What it is

A SolidWorks-style desktop CAD app: a feature tree on the left, a ribbon of commands on top, a 3D viewport in the middle, and a command line along the bottom that opens an AI assistant session.

SolidDraft is built for [Catallax](https://github.com/BohnBawerick/catallax) and will run only on it. They are one project in two repositories: SolidDraft is the CAD application and Catallax is its kernel. The desktop, browser and command-line application run on Catallax. See the [project website](https://kernel.zigrawbohnbawerick.org/) and the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## What works today

Work in progress. SolidDraft runs only on Catallax. See [the backend gaps](docs/needs-catallax.md) for the limits of the current application entry.

- The desktop app, with its ribbon, feature tree, property panel, command line, assistant session and wgpu viewport.
- Desktop depth, fillet-radius and chamfer-distance edits separate construction display from exact proof. Supported construction charts produce selectable provisional faces before proof finishes; one drag is one undo step. Pending or failed input cannot export, and a failed edit restores the whole last proved part while its feature stays red with a reason.
- Sketching on a plane or a planar face with line, rectangle, circle, arc and slot tools, with relations and dimensions.
- Extrudes and cuts, blind, through all, up to the next boundary or up to a planar face; booleans and rational-frame revolves through the kernel and recipe runner. The revolve ribbon command still waits for its application editor. Persistent references, undo and redo, feature tree editing and part files work.
- Holes on a planar face, blind or through, with flat or drill-point tips, counterbores and countersinks at any angle, including the standard 118° tip and 82°, 90° and 100° countersinks. A countersink or drill point cannot yet go into a body that has another cylinder; see [the backend gaps](docs/needs-catallax.md).
- Linear and circular patterns and mirrors of the part's body.
- Analytic planar shells with selected open faces, editable wall thickness and persistent inner-wall names. See [shell coverage and evidence](docs/l08-shell-tool.md).
- Fillets and equal-distance chamfers between planes and between planes and cylinders, and drafts of planar faces and cylinders parallel to the pull.
- Drawings use Catallax meshes for polygon hidden-line removal. Plane sections on screen are cut from the same meshes; an exported section subtracts a half-space through a Catallax boolean. ISO and ANSI sheets, aligned views, dimensions and annotations keep their formats. Output to drawing files, SVG, PDF and DXF works, and every exported view curve says whether it is the model's exact line or circle or a mesh polyline. Exact silhouettes and some curve conversions remain pending.
- The assistant, connected to Claude: it reads the part, proposes changes as cards you preview, apply and undo. The same commands are open to outside agents over MCP.
- A headless command line that replays recipes, rebuilds parts, renders hidden-line views and makes drawings.
- A WebAssembly build that runs the app and Catallax in one browser module.

Waiting commands stay visible and disabled with a tooltip naming their Catallax stage. Opening a part with a waiting feature rebuilds its available prefix and marks the feature with an error; that prefix is not a proved whole part and cannot export.

| Waiting feature | Catallax stage |
|---|---|
| Offset and thicken; unsupported shell envelopes | 3 |
| Up to a curved face (Catallax covers bare stock targets only) | 3 |
| Other fillets | 4 |
| Sweep and loft; spline, ellipse and text profiles | 5 |
| STEP import | 6 |

Parts export as STEP AP242 and supported exact-surface IGES 5.3 with Catallax's proven deviation, and as STL, 3MF and OBJ from Catallax's meshes, from File > Export or `soliddraft export`; see [part export](docs/exchange.md). IGES import, surfacing and sheet metal are not available. In the desktop app an assembly opens in a tab beside the part: File > New assembly or Make assembly from part, insert parts from a file dialog or by dropping their files on the window, place each by typing its position and rotation, then save and reopen it; see [assemblies](docs/assemblies.md#in-the-app). Mates come next. The [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) orders the remaining work.

## Building

You need Rust 1.95 or later. There is no C++ kernel, submodule or separate kernel build.

```sh
cargo build --release --locked
```

## Running the app

```sh
cargo run --release -p soliddraft-app -- --demo
```

A part or drawing file on the command line opens it. `--demo` loads a sample part, `--bench` measures frame times on a dense body and exits, `--screenshot out.png` saves the window and exits, `--help` lists the rest. Press `?` in the app for the keyboard shortcuts.

Modelling starts with a sketch: pick a plane in the tree or click a planar face, draw, add dimensions with `D`, then Extrude or Cut from the property panel. Hole, Fillet, Chamfer, Draft, the patterns and Mirror work on the body from the ribbon. Fillet and Chamfer take picked edges, or a picked face for every edge on its boundary; one the kernel refuses is not added, and the note gives the kernel's reason.

## Running in a browser

The app also runs in a web browser as WebAssembly. A small server serves it and holds the assistant's API key. The browser shares the revision and export guards, but construction and exact proof still run on its interface thread: the desktop's responsive-worker behaviour is not a browser capability claim. See `docs/web.md`.

## The assistant

The assistant needs an Anthropic API key, from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or the OS keychain:

```sh
printf %s "$KEY" | cargo run --release -p soliddraft-cli -- key set
```

Without a key the app runs and the assistant session says the assistant is off. `--mcp [PORT]` serves the open part to MCP clients such as Claude Code; `soliddraft mcp` serves a headless part over stdio, and `soliddraft run` runs the same commands from a shell or a script. See `docs/assistant.md`. Agent scenarios, per-command evidence bundles and windowless viewport captures are described in [the application loop](docs/application-loop.md).

## Command line

```sh
cargo run --release -p soliddraft-cli -- replay --steps recipes/union.json
cargo run --release -p soliddraft-cli -- view recipes/bracket.json --dir front,top,right,iso --svg 'bracket-{view}.svg'
cargo run --release -p soliddraft-cli -- part bracket.dwprt
cargo run --release -p soliddraft-cli -- export recipes/bracket.json --out bracket.step --out bracket.3mf --out bracket.obj
cargo run --release -p soliddraft-cli -- draw recipes/bracket.json --template iso-a3
```

Replay prints each step's face, edge and vertex counts, volume, area, validity and a geometric digest. Export writes STEP, IGES, STL, 3MF or OBJ, chosen by each `--out` file's extension, with each file's deviation. View writes hidden-line views. Part rebuilds a saved part and prints every feature's state. Draw makes a full drawing of a recipe's result. Each subcommand has `--help`.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

The app's exit tests drive the real interface through `egui_kittest` on wgpu and skip themselves on a machine with no GPU adapter.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Read `docs/DESIGN.md` for the app's interface to the kernel and `docs/modelling.md` for the document model before changing either. Keep document and viewport code behind the existing kernel interface; Catallax is the only backend. Run `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo test --workspace` before you open a pull request. Agent-written code is fine and expected; say so in the pull request, and stay accountable for what it does.

If a change needs a new kernel operation, describe it in an issue before changing the bridge.
