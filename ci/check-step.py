"""Opens a SolidDraft STEP export in OpenCASCADE and checks it against the export report.

usage: check-step.py <file.step> <report.json>

<report.json> is the acceptance test's STEP report and exact-body measurements. The check
passes when OpenCASCADE reads the file into one valid solid whose face count equals both
the report's and the exact body's less the faces the report says the export removed, and
whose volume is within the reported deviation of the exact volume. Each removed count
must be a whole number from 0 to the exact body's count. A surface moved by at most d changes the enclosed volume by at most
area * d to first order in d, so the allowance is area * d, where d is the reported
deviation plus any fitted surface's reported fit to its exact definition, plus OpenCASCADE's own
estimate of its integration error, plus the exact volume's measurement width (a
relative 1e-12 around Catallax's proven enclosure).

A design may state expected_export_faces when STEP splits logical faces into patches.
The file and report must both match that independent expectation.

This checker belongs to CI. The application never runs OpenCASCADE.
