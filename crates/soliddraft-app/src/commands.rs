//! The command registry: one row per command a person or an agent can run.
//!
//! The ribbon, the keyboard shortcuts, the menus, the shortcuts window, the command palette,
//! the command search, the assistant's recipe verbs, the MCP server and the CLI all read
//! this table, so a command has one id, one label, one description and one set of shortcuts
//! everywhere.
//!
//! A row describes and dispatches a command; it does not replace the typed commands
//! underneath. In the app a row yields a typed [`AppAction`]; for an agent, a verb's
//! input parses into a typed recipe [`Line`](crate::command_tools::Line) that runs as
//! `soliddraft_model` commands, and the other tools run the same typed commands through
//! [`AppTools`](crate::app_tools::AppTools), which the MCP servers and `soliddraft run`
//! serve. A command that needs the window says why in its row ([`Agents::App`]).
//!
//! A tab's panels come in the order [`panels`] gives, and each panel lists its commands
//! in table order.
