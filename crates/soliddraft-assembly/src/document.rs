//! An open assembly: its truth, what it shows, the edits made to it and their undo.
//!
//! [`AssemblyDocument`] is what the interface and the command line hold. Opening reads
//! the structure at once and loads display meshes in the background
//! ([`AssemblyDocument::poll`] takes in what has arrived), so the assembly can be shown
//! and edited from the first frame. Edits change the root's truth and the occurrence
//! table in place:
//!
//! - an occurrence that is one of the root's components is changed on the component;
//! - anything deeper, or a pattern member, is changed through an override in the root
//!   (an assembly-level change, like SolidWorks's), and its own file is not touched.
//!
//! Mates and values change through the commands in [`crate::mates`], which solve a
//! candidate and commit here. Every edit is one undo step. What changed for the renderer since it last looked is
//! collected in [`Changes`].
