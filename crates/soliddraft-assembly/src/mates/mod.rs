//! Mates: authored relationships that decide where components sit.
//!
//! A mate names faces by occurrence path and the part's persistent [`FaceRef`], never by
//! label or kernel handle. Distances are typed expressions; one that reads an assembly
//! value is driven by it. Definitions are the assembly's truth. Proofs, solver status and
//! diagnostics are derived and stay out of it.
//!
//! - [`solver`] places components from proven plane equations and counts what stays free.
//! - [`reference`] finds faces and proves their planes at a pinned revision.
//! - [`command`] runs every change as one candidate: preview, prove, solve, then commit.
//! - [`bodies`] reads the mates of the root and of every sub-assembly in it, and the
//!   part occurrences they move, by path.
//!
//! There are three families: an Origin mate, a distance between planar faces, and two
//! planar faces on one plane. They cover axis-aligned planes with exact offsets; see
//! `docs/mates.md`.
