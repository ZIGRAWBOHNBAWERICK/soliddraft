//! The flat occurrence table: one row per placed part or sub-assembly, anywhere in the
//! tree.
//!
//! The renderer, the picker and the bounding volume hierarchy read columns of this
//! table; nothing walks a nested tree per frame. Row 0 is the root assembly. Every
//! other row has a parent row (the sub-assembly occurrence that contains it), the
//! [`Step`] that leads to it from there, its definition, its placement relative to the
//! parent and in the world (both `f64`), its world bounds and its flags. Children are a
//! linked list per row, so inserting a component appends rows without moving others.
//!
//! Row numbers ([`OccurrenceIndex`]) are stable while the table lives; they are not
//! written to files. Paths ([`OccurrencePath`]) are what persists.
//!
//! Edits work in place: moving an occurrence updates the world placements and bounds of
//! its subtree; hiding one updates the effective hidden flag of its subtree. Neither
//! touches any other row.
