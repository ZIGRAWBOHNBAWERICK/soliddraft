//! Where display meshes and exact bodies come from when an assembly's own copies do
//! not have them.
//!
//! An assembly normally shows its parts from the display copies in its file. A copy can
//! be missing (the cache was dropped, or a Rebuild needs the current revision of a
//! part), and exact work (measure, mass, drawing projection) needs the kernel body. Both
//! start from a part file's bytes; a [`DisplaySource`] turns them into a display mesh.
//!
//! - [`FileSource`] reads the display data the part file keeps for its current geometry
//!   (see `soliddraft_model::display`). It needs no kernel, so a browser or a lightweight
//!   open shows parts without rebuilding them.
//! - [`KernelSource`] reads the same display data first, and otherwise rebuilds the part
//!   on a kernel and tessellates it. It also builds the exact part.
