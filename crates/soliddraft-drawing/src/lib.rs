//! SolidDraft drawings: sheets of 2D views of a part, with dimensions and notes tied to
//! the part's entities.
//!
//! A [`Drawing`] is its own document. It references the part with a [`DocRef`]: the
//! part's id, its path relative to the drawing, and the part revision the views were
//! made from, which the drawing keeps showing until a Rebuild moves it. It holds one or
//! more [`Sheet`]s. Each sheet holds
//! [`View`]s, whose line work is cached as [`ViewGeometry`] so a drawing opens without
//! the kernel, and [`Annotation`]s, whose [`Anchor`]s name model entities by persistent
//! [`EntityRef`]s rather than by view geometry. Every change goes through a [`Command`].
//!
//! Units are millimetres and degrees. Sheet coordinates start at the paper's bottom-left
//! corner with Y up.
//!
//! Phase D1 makes a drawing without a window: [`make_drawing`] projects the part's views
//! through the kernel, picks the sheet scale, places the views with their alignments and
//! brings in the part's dimensions ([`model_items`]); [`update_from_model`] keeps the
//! drawing tied to the part; [`display::layout`] turns a sheet into the display list
//! every renderer draws; [`file`] reads and writes the drawing file; and [`export`]
//! writes SVG, PDF and DXF from the display list. [`fixture::bracket_a3`] is a sample
//! drawing that needs no kernel.
