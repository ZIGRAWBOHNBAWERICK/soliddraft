//! Where faces came from, and what each operation did to faces and edges.
//!
//! Every face a backend reports lists its [`Origin`]s: the operations, by the caller's
//! [`OpTag`], that made it and the part each one played ([`FaceRole`]), kept through
//! splits and merges. The document layer names a face by one of its origins and finds
//! it again by that origin; this is the foundation of persistent naming.
//!
//! Every face, edge and vertex also carries an id ([`FaceId`], [`EdgeId`], [`VertexId`])
//! that survives later operations for as long as the entity does. Each operation appends
//! one [`HistoryRecord`] that lists the entities it created, modified, deleted or split,
//! and the role of each face it created. Drawings, the recipe runner and edge labels read
//! these records.
