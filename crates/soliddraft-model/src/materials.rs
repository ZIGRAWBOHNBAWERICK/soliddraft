//! A part's material and appearances.
//!
//! A part has a material (none until one is assigned) and appearances on the whole part,
//! on the faces a feature made, or on single faces. The most specific wins: a face's
//! own appearance, then its feature's, then the part's, then the material's default
//! appearance, then SolidDraft's default grey. Faces are named persistently (see
//! [`reference`](crate::reference)), so an appearance follows its face through edits;
//! a face that splits keeps the appearance on every piece, and an assignment whose
//! face is gone is reported as lost rather than moved to another face.
//!
//! Every assignment carries a configuration scope. Until configurations exist the
//! scope is always "all", and the part is shown in its default configuration.
//!
//! The part keeps a copy of every material and appearance it uses, so its look and mass
//! never depend on a library (see [`soliddraft_materials::Snapshots`]).
