//! The rebuild cache: feature builds kept by the exact inputs they read.
//!
//! Kernel bodies are immutable, so a feature built once from the same definition and the
//! same input bodies gives the same result. The cache keeps each build under a key of
//! its exact inputs: the feature, the exact bytes of its definition, the body it starts from,
//! and, for an extrusion, the build of the sketch it sweeps. A body handle names one
//! immutable body and is never reused, so it stands for everything that built the body.
//! Nothing is keyed by rounded coordinates.
//!
//! A rebuild walks the tree from the first changed feature and asks the cache before
//! building. An edit misses from the edited feature down. Undo, redo and a value put
//! back find the earlier builds and reuse their bodies.
//!
//! The cache owns the bodies its builds made. A copy of the part shares them, and the
//! last cache to drop a build releases its body. It keeps the retained bytes of its builds within a budget by dropping the least
//! recently used builds the current tree does not use, and with them every build that
//! started from a body it released.
