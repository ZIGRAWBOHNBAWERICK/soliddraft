//! SolidDraft recipes: a model as an ordered list of kernel commands with named
//! references, replayable on any backend of the kernel trait.
//!
//! Recipes are the conformance corpus: replaying one reports face and edge counts,
//! volume, area, validity and a geometric digest, so two runs, or two backends, can be
//! compared by their reports.
