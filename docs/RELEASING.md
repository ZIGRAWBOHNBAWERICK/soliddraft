# Releasing SolidDraft

## Version rule and first-release gate

SolidDraft uses `0.x.y` versions. Every `0.x` release is labelled **alpha** and marked as a GitHub prerelease. Numbers describe completed work, never dates. Increase the minor number for a completed capability milestone and the patch number for fixes to that milestone. Set `[workspace.package].version` in `Cargo.toml`; packaging reads that value rather than maintaining a second release counter. Keep `Cargo.lock` in sync when changing the workspace version.

Before the first `0.1.0` cut, record an explicit landed-or-parked disposition for the work in flight at the candidate freeze. Included feature work must have landed and been pushed to `main`; parked work remains unfinished. Preparing or merging release machinery is not permission to publish. There are no scheduled releases or nightlies.

The freeze selects release candidates, not a development stop. Record both repositories' frozen commit hashes and create `release/<version>` branches from them. Continue development on `main`. Final kernel pins, acceptance, packages and smoke checks use the release branches. A blocker fix lands on `main` through its owning lane first, then is cherry-picked to the release branch, unless the fix applies only to the release. Record the resulting candidate hashes and repeat affected exact-source evidence after each fix. If release checks are starved by development CI, ask the integration owner to prioritize the release queue; do not cancel other lanes' runs yourself.

## What the workflow builds

`.github/workflows/release.yml` uses cargo-packager 0.11.8 for platform packages and Trunk 0.21.14 for the browser build. Archive names include the workspace version.

| Platform | Downloads |
|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `.msi`, portable `.zip` |
| macOS Intel and Apple Silicon | universal `.dmg`, containing both architectures |
| Linux x86_64 | `.AppImage`, `.deb`, portable `.tar.gz` |
| Browser | `.zip`, with relative asset URLs suitable for a GitHub Pages project path |
| Release metadata | `SHA256SUMS`, SPDX JSON SBOM, generated `release-notes.md` |

Windows packages are [deferred](ci.md#windows-is-deferred): until the catch-up, a release has no Windows downloads, and `.msi` and `.zip` appear only in a Hosted CI run with `windows_catch_up` on. Windows builds link the C runtime statically. Assembly inspects the portable executable's imports and rejects a dependency on the separately installed Visual C++ runtime.

Linux packages build on Ubuntu 22.04. The portable tar needs the host's graphics drivers and desktop libraries; the AppImage bundles dependencies through cargo-packager. The archive packages include LICENSE and NOTICE. The Debian package and installers also include them as resources.

Winit loads XKB libraries at runtime rather than linking them into the executable. `packaging/Packager.json` explicitly includes those libraries and the XCB XKB dependency in the AppImage, and declares desktop/graphics runtime dependencies for Debian. Keep these declarations aligned with the packaged startup smoke, not just the binary's `ldd` output.

Linux desktop entries declare `application/vnd.soliddraft.part` for `.dwprt` and `application/vnd.soliddraft.drawing` for `.dwdrw`. Both the Debian package and AppImage include `packaging/soliddraft-mime.xml` under `usr/share/mime/packages/soliddraft.xml`. Debian requires `shared-mime-info` and `desktop-file-utils` for MIME and desktop-database registration. The `.dwasm` assembly extension has no association; open assemblies from inside the application. Portable archives and an unintegrated AppImage do not install system file associations; verify double-click opening using the installed desktop package.

The SBOM comes from cached, checksum-verified Syft 1.42.3. It inventories the checked-out source, locked dependencies and staged packages; it is not a claim that every workspace dependency is linked into every executable. The tag workflow creates GitHub build-provenance attestations for every downloadable file, including the notes, SBOM and checksum manifest. Dry runs do not publish attestations.

Generated notes compare document formats with the highest published version below the candidate version, even when that tag is on another release branch. Pull request lists include original merge commits and fixes recorded by `git cherry-pick -x`, and exclude pull requests already shipped in the previous release. Notes also link the SolidDraft website.

Verify a download with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` after downloading the complete set, or check its individual entry. Verify provenance with:

```sh
gh attestation verify soliddraft-0.1.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage --repo BohnBawerick/soliddraft
```

## Dry run, without publishing

Select **Release packages > Run workflow** on the candidate's versioned release branch, or run:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml --ref release/0.1.0
```

`workflow_dispatch` always builds without creating a release, deploying Pages, signing with repository credentials or publishing attestations. It takes no publish switch. A pull request that changes release configuration also runs the same complete packaging path. This lets a new workflow be tested before GitHub permits manual dispatch from the default branch.

Feature-branch dry runs cancel their superseded runs. Each run on `main`, a `release/` branch or a version tag has its own concurrency group and cannot cancel or replace another protected run. A manual check against a release tag must not interrupt publishing.

Download these run artifacts:

- `release-dry-run`, the exact packages, SBOM, notes and SHA256SUMS. That is five packages, or seven with the deferred Windows pair.
- `github-pages`, the deploy-ready Pages tar payload. Uploading this artifact does not enable a site.
- `appimage-smoke` and `browser-smoke`, screenshots from the packaged builds.

The Linux smoke starts the AppImage under Xvfb with a software Vulkan adapter, opens the demo and requires the application to save a screenshot and exit. The browser smoke extracts the release zip and serves it under `/soliddraft/` in headless Chromium. It requires a successful WASM response, completion of application startup, a sized canvas and no JavaScript exceptions or application panic messages.

Before release, also download the AppImage and browser zip from the successful run and exercise them on the validation machine. The browser can use a local static HTTP server, not a public self-hosted service. Use `/usr/bin/chromium` for the local headless check. Keep screenshots and logs attached to the pull request or workflow run, not in the repository.

## Release checklist

1. Confirm the first-release gate above and record the landed/parked scope and frozen base commits. Create the versioned release branches without holding development on `main`.
2. Confirm the candidate release commit is green in Hosted CI, including application scenarios and survival checks. Hosted CI reports click budgets as warnings; the strict release verdict below confirms them. Packaging success does not replace these checks. The tag workflow requires a successful Hosted CI push run on `release/<version>` at the tagged commit.
3. Test the supported desktop part and drawing flows. Open older supported `.dwprt` and `.dwdrw` documents, save and reopen them, and check document identities and references.
   Separately, run the `.dwasm` assembly-format and schema checks. Desktop assemblies are created, saved and reopened from inside the application. Installers do not register an assembly file association, so double-clicking a `.dwasm` file does not open it. Keep the format and extension unchanged.
4. Commit the final kernel pin, workspace version and generated lockfile on the release branch. Run the full release dry run at that exact commit. Inspect all five packages, the SBOM, SHA256SUMS, generated notes and both smoke screenshots. After installation, double-click a `.dwprt` part and a `.dwdrw` drawing and confirm that each opens in the application.
5. Review the generated source revisions and document-format lines. Notes record the exact SolidDraft commit and Catallax pin, and generation rejects disagreement between the adapter dependencies, backend identity and locked kernel sources. These identities do not substitute for acceptance of that source pair. The generator reads `DocKind::format` at the release commit and the nearest reachable previous released tag. It reports each current format and explicitly names a changed previous version. The first release prints all current format versions. Migration details belong in the merged change's pull request and `docs/documents.md`, not a hand-edited changelog.
6. Review signing status. Until credentials exist, macOS and Windows builds are unsigned. Warn users about Gatekeeper and SmartScreen; do not claim that an attestation is an operating-system signing certificate.
7. Only after approval, push the version tag from that green release commit. For example, `git tag v0.1.0 <commit>` followed by `git push origin v0.1.0`. The tag must match the workspace version exactly and its commit must be reachable from the matching `release/0.1.0` branch, not merely `main`.
8. Inspect the created GitHub prerelease, asset inventory, checksums and attestations. Do not move an existing release tag. Fix a failed or incorrect published build with a new patch release after completing validation.

Release notes are generated from merged GitHub pull requests whose merge commits fall between the nearest previous released tag and the current commit. The generator lists titles, authors and links, then adds the document-format versions and alpha/file-backup warning. It uses read-only GitHub APIs and includes prereleases when finding the previous release. Do not maintain a hand-edited CHANGELOG.

### Joint application and kernel cut

Qualify kernel changes before updating the application's shared dependency pins and lockfile. Keep one integration owner for these files. Record the exact qualified kernel commit, the application commit containing that pin, both green source-check runs and both package dry runs in the release review. A later source change invalidates affected evidence; do not reuse a screenshot or replay as proof of an untested source pair.

For the ordinary-parts alpha, require the SolidDraft application bracket, edited collar, safe provisional-edit and failure recovery, checked output settings and requested drill-point measurement paths. Resolve the rounded-boss correctness assessment for every affected shipped path before tagging. Full canonical P1 is a separate stretch gate; the application bracket cannot stand in for it. Use the existing application scenario runner's strict release verdict, not a known-over-budget exemption or a kernel-only result.

Reserve an actual desktop interaction session on the validation machine. Download the candidate AppImage and browser zip from the recorded successful package run. Open an accepted part, select and edit it, export it, then reopen its saved drawing. Also reopen older supported part and drawing files. Retain the exact recipe/settings, source pair, screenshots, command logs, timing/proof verdicts and output hashes outside the source tree. Test the downloaded browser build locally with the same paths it advertises. Do not enable public Pages for validation.

The release review must distinguish package generation, downloaded-build interaction and source acceptance. Missing evidence keeps the tag on hold, even when the preparation pull requests or packaging jobs are green. This checklist does not waive the first-release gate, the kernel's milestone policy or either repository's exact-commit evidence requirements.

## Optional signing credentials

Set repository secrets only when the matching certificates and accounts exist. Secrets never belong in configuration files, artifacts or documentation examples. Pull requests and manual dry runs never receive signing credentials. Signing failures on the tag path fail the package job.

| Repository secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded PFX code-signing certificate, imported into the ephemeral runner's current-user certificate store |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | PFX password |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Certificate export password |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | Full Developer ID Application signing identity |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple Developer account used by notarytool |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for that account |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Developer team ID |

The Windows package job imports the PFX, passes its thumbprint to cargo-packager and enables SHA-256 signing with RFC 3161 timestamping. cargo-packager signs the executable and MSI before the portable archive and checksums are created. On macOS, setting `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` requires the complete signing and notarization secret set. cargo-packager imports the certificate into a temporary keychain, signs with hardened runtime, notarizes and staples the application before creating the DMG. With no certificate, packaging remains unsigned. Certificate-backed signing cannot be validated until the owner supplies credentials.

## Pages stays off until explicitly approved

No Pages site is enabled by this change. Every successful browser build uploads `github-pages` as a workflow artifact, which is the dry run of the deploy payload.

After the owner approves public browser hosting, configure the repository's Pages source as **GitHub Actions**, protect the `github-pages` environment as appropriate, and set repository variable `SOLIDDRAFT_PAGES_ENABLED=true`. The existing deploy job then deploys only after a successful tag release. Do not set the variable or enable Pages merely to test packaging. Manual dispatch and pull requests cannot deploy, even when the variable is set.

GitHub Pages is static hosting. The modelling kernel runs in the browser; there is no server assistant relay and no bundled API key. A public assistant service is not part of this release machinery.

## Interface work outside this change

This workflow adds no application interface. The design lane owns final package icon artwork, download-page layout, and any in-app update or unsigned-build messaging. The packaging icon is a minimal cube so installers can be exercised now. Those interface choices must not add timing or release instrumentation to modelling or user-edit code paths.
