# Sub-assemblies

Form subassembly moves chosen parts of the open assembly into a new assembly file of their
own, and places that file in the root where the parts were. Nothing moves in the world.
The code is `crates/soliddraft-assembly/src/subassembly/`; the command is
`crates/soliddraft-app/src/subassembly/`. The file format is [assemblies.md](assemblies.md)'s
and mates are [mates.md](mates.md)'s.

## What it takes

An ordered list of distinct part occurrences placed directly in the root, the new file's
path, and which of the parts gives the new file its frame. This version forms:

- part components of the root, not sub-assemblies or pattern members;
- in their default state: not hidden or suppressed, without an assembly colour, a display
  quality of their own, overrides, configurations or a pattern seeded on them;
- with mates the new file can hold whole: a Coincident between two chosen parts moves, and
  a distance between them moves only when its distance is a literal. One that reads a root
  value, an Origin mate on a chosen part, or a mate of a later version is refused, never
  dropped.

Anything else is refused by name before anything is made.

## What it makes

Let E be the accepted placement of the origin part. The new file's frame is E: each part
keeps its component id and is placed at `E⁻¹ ∘ W` in it, where W is its root placement,
so the origin part sits at the new file's origin and every part's world pose is the same.
The root places the new file once, at E, under a source and a component taken from its own
id counter.

| Reference | After |
|---|---|
| A chosen part | Its id and source move into the new file. The source keeps its id, document, configuration and pin; its path points, relative to the new file, where the root finds the document now, even when that is not where the root's stored path says. Parts that shared a source still share one |
| A mate between two chosen parts | Moves into the new file under the same id, with the same endpoints |
| A mate between a chosen part and another | Stays in the root under the same id; the chosen end's path gains the new component in front, such as `4` to `16/4` |
| Any other mate, every value and binding | Unchanged in the root |
| The root's sources | Only those its remaining components place, and the new file |

The new file's `next_id` is above every id it carries. The command returns the whole map:
each occurrence's path before, after and in the new file, and each mate's id with its
owner before and after (`Migration`), so whatever else names them can follow.

A part no mate holds stays as free as it was: no mate, fixed flag or Origin relation is
added, in the new file or in the root.

## Solving across the boundary

The root solves its own mates and every sub-assembly's, each read with the sub-assembly's
path in front, over the part occurrences they name. A sub-assembly's frame stays where it is
authored: it is a frame, not a body with freedoms of its own. A part inside it that a solve
moves is kept as an override in the root (relative to the sub-assembly, as every override
is), and the sub-assembly's own file is never written. Freedoms count the part occurrences
that move on their own, at any depth; a pattern member follows its seed.

So a root driving a part inside a sub-assembly moves that part and whatever the
sub-assembly's own mates tie to it, and leaves the sub-assembly's free parts alone.

## Updating across files

A part edit reaches the root only through the sub-assembly that places it, each file
accepting what it places with its own Update, the way assemblies always work
([assemblies.md](assemblies.md#rebuild)):

1. The part is saved. Nothing else changes: the sub-assembly and the root keep showing,
   proving and solving on the revisions they pinned. A session that recorded the old bytes
   keeps proving on them.
2. The root's Update accepts only its own sources. With only a part inside the sub-assembly
   newer, it accepts nothing, records no step, and `assembly_update` lists those parts under
   `nested_newer` with the sub-assembly (`holder`) that has to update first.
3. The sub-assembly, opened on its own, updates and is saved.
4. The root's Update then accepts the sub-assembly's new revision with its parts' new pins,
   proving the mates that cross into it on them, in one step.

No Update writes a file; each file is written by its own Save. A session that keeps the root
open sees the part move on too: the status of every reference, inside sub-assemblies as well,
is refreshed from the file that holds it, which changes no pin, pose or history.

## Publication and history

Both candidate truths are made, flattened and solved before anything is written: the root
with the new file placed in it, and the new file on its own. Neither may move anything.
Committing then checks that the root and every chosen source are still at the revisions the
plan was prepared on, and each source still where it was found (the new file's bytes name
that place; a source moved meanwhile, even at the same revision, makes the plan stale), writes the new file with `soliddraft_document::save_new`, which never
replaces a file (even one made a moment before), and only then makes the formed root the
accepted one, in one undo step labelled `Form subassembly`. The root's own file is written
when it is saved.

A refusal at any point leaves the accepted root, its history and every file as they were.
Undo restores the root exactly, flat, and leaves the new file where it is: undo deletes no
file. Redo brings back the same new file's id and pin and writes nothing; if the file was
edited meanwhile the root says it has moved on, and only Update accepts it.

Inserting a component reads the new structure before accepting it, so a sub-assembly
cannot place an assembly that places it: that is refused as `cycle`, naming the occurrence
the cycle runs through, and nothing changes.

| Code | Why |
|---|---|
| `invalid` | An empty, repeated or unknown selection, an origin outside it, or a name not ending in `.dwasm` |
| `unsupported` | Something the new file could not carry whole (see above) |
| `cycle` | The new structure would contain itself |
| `missing_reference` | A chosen part's document cannot be found; the copy the root shows does not stand in for it |
| `stale_revision` | The root or a chosen source changed after the plan was prepared |
| `destination_exists` | The new file's name is taken |
| `io` | The new file could not be written |

A crash after the new file is written and before the root changes leaves a complete new file
that nothing references, beside the root's file as last saved. Both open; forming again
needs a new name.

## In the window

In the assembly tree a click chooses one part and a Ctrl-click (Cmd on a Mac) adds another
or takes it away, in order. Form subassembly… in a row's context menu opens a panel with
the chosen parts, the first giving the frame, and a field for the new file, relative to the
assembly's folder unless absolute. Apply runs the same command as the tool; a refusal stays
in the panel. The panel belongs to the assembly it was opened on: opening or making another
assembly in its place closes it, and Apply forms nothing in an assembly it was not opened on. The selection and the chosen parts follow into the new file, and the tree
opens on it. A click in the viewport names the occurrence and the part's persistent face
under it at any depth, such as `16/4` and B's underside. A part inside a sub-assembly moves
through the placement fields like any other; the root keeps the move as an override.

A root whose sub-assembly file cannot be found opens from its own copies and says so; its
Update is refused as `missing_reference`, naming the file, and changes nothing.

## Command

`assembly_form_subassembly {paths, path, origin}` forms the open assembly's parts named by
`paths` (such as `["4", "5", "6"]`) into `path`, with the frame of `origin`. Its result holds
`formed` (the file, the migration and both solver statuses), `child` (the new file's id,
revision and truth) and `selected`, the selection after the move: a selected part is
selected again at its nested path. `model_summary`'s assembly lists every occurrence at any
depth under `occurrences`, keyed by path, with its source, pin, local and root placement,
box, the mates it takes part in and the motions it keeps.

`ci/scenarios/subassembly-form.json` runs the V6 batch 1 design's manifest through MCP.

## Limits for later batches

Forming from inside a sub-assembly, sub-assemblies or pattern members as selected
occurrences, configurations, values passed into a sub-assembly, and dissolving or
reorganising a tree (M10).
